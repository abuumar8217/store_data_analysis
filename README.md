Project Objectives and Approach:

As part of our data exploration and analysis project using the SuperStore dataset, the following steps have been undertaken to derive meaningful insights and prepare the data for deeper analysis:

Dataset Utilization: Leveraged the SuperStore dataset as the primary data source for analysis.

Feature Engineering â€“ Age: Created a new column labeled Age, derived from the existing data fields (e.g., birth year or other relevant timestamps).

Generational Categorization: Developed an AgeCat column to classify individuals into generational cohorts based on their age, using a predefined generation labeling schema.

Insight Generation: Extracted a minimum of three key insights from the dataset through exploratory data analysis, focusing on patterns, trends, and anomalies.

Visualization: Produced at least one data visualization to support and communicate the insights effectively.
